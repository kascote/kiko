# Kiko

**Note**: This project is a work in progress and will be updated as time permits.

Kiko is a Dart port of the [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) Rust framework for building TUI (Text User Interface) applications.

The basics are working, but event handling and some other features still need to be implemented.

Here are some examples:

## Layout
